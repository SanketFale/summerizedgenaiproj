 "hallucination" — especially in the context of our previous conversation about generative AI.
In AI (particularly generative AI like large language models — LLMs such as me, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), the correct and widely used term is:
AI hallucination (or generative AI hallucination / LLM hallucination)
What is an AI hallucination?
It happens when a generative AI model confidently produces information that is:

Factually wrong
Made-up / fabricated
Misleading
Nonsensical

… but presents it as if it were completely true and accurate.
The output often sounds very plausible, is written in fluent, professional language, and includes invented details (fake citations, wrong dates, nonexistent people/events, impossible facts, etc.).
Classic Everyday Examples

A model claims: "The winner of the 2026 Cricket World Cup was India" (when the tournament hasn't happened yet or the result is different).
It invents a fake research paper: "According to Smith et al. (2025) in Nature…" — but no such paper exists.
Image generators give people six fingers, extra limbs, or text that looks like real writing but is gibberish.
Code suggestions include functions that look correct but actually crash or do the wrong thing
